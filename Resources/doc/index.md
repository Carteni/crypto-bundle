MesCryptoBundle Documentation
=============================

The aim of **MesCryptoBundle** is to facilitate **symmetric-key authenticated encryption** in a Symfony application.

Encryption
----------
**Encryption** is the process of making data unreadable by other humans or computers for the purpose of preventing others from gaining access to its contents. **Encrypted** data is generated using an encryption program such as PGP, encryption machine, or a simple **encryption key** and appears as garbage until it is decrypted. To read or use the data, it must be decrypted, and only those who have the correct password or decryption key can make the data readable again.

Decryption
----------
**Decryption** is the process of taking encoded or encrypted text or other data and converting it back into text that you or the computer can read and understand. This term could be used to describe a method of un-encrypting the data manually or with un-encrypting the data using the proper codes or keys.
